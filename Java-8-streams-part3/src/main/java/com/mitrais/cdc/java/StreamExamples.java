/** TO DO 
 *  - You will generate very large array of random doubles 
 *  arraySize: 100_000_000
 *  (you can use randomArray method on MathUtils.java)
 *  - Compute the sum of the square roots of the numbers in the array 
 *  Find a shorter and simpler way than making a loop to tally the sum
 *  (You could use available method sqrtSum and sqrtSumParallel on MathUtils.java) 
 *  - Test whether the parallel approach is faster than the sequential approach
 *  using timeOp method on Op.java
